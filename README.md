# FrontiersMarket Replica and Chat Widget

This project is a recreation of the [frontiersmarket.com](https://frontiersmarket.com/) homepage as a static website. It also includes a chat widget overlaying the website, displaying ongoing conversations with one or many real persons. Firestore Realtime Database is used to store the conversations, and the chat UI was developed by me. Additionally, a sign-in functionality is implemented, allowing users to sign in with their Google account through Firebase Authentication, or with their email and password.

## Technologies Used

- **Create React App:** Bootstrapped the project using Create React App for quick setup and development.
- **Firebase Auth:** Integrated Firebase Authentication for user authentication.
- **Firebase Realtime Database:** Used Firestore to store and manage ongoing conversations in real-time.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Employed Tailwind CSS for a utility-first approach to styling.
- **React Toastify:** Implemented React Toastify for displaying user-friendly notifications.
- **React Router DOM:** Used React Router DOM for handling navigation within the application.
- **Typescript:** The entire codebase is written in TypeScript for static typing.

_Note: In a real project, I would __not__ upload the .env file, but in this case, this way it is easier for you to run it locally._
